# dataflow-examples
This repository is a collection of examples of the data flow possible in Java programs.

## Graphical representations
Besides the code of each example, there are graphical representations in the form of GraphML diagrams.
To open/modify them, the yEd Graph Editor (https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) can be used, which is also available as a browser-based live version (https://www.yworks.com/products/yed-live). 
So no local installation is required.


## Naming conventions
- Basic examples: Minimal description of the given data flow in the form <fromConstruct>To<toConstruct>
- Composite examples: "Composite" + the current running index value
- Classes: Single letters starting from A
- Methods: Single letters starting from m, omitting o
- Fields/parameters/locals: Single letters starting from a
